────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  STEP 1 — CUSTOMER BOOKS A CLEANING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The customer visits the website and fills out a 5-step form.

  Step 1 · Choose a service
           - Regular Cleaning    (weekly / fortnightly upkeep)
           - Deep Cleaning        (seasonal or detailed reset)
           - End of Lease         (bond-back for rentals)

  Step 2 · Tell us about the property
           - How many bedrooms? (1–5)
           - How many bathrooms? (1–4)
           - Price estimate shows live on screen

  Step 3 · Pick a date and time
           - Customer picks a date from the calendar
           - Available time slots appear automatically:
             8:00 AM / 10:00 AM / 12:00 PM / 2:00 PM / 4:00 PM
           - Fully booked slots are greyed out — can't be selected
           - If a slot is full, the system suggests the next
             available time or date automatically

  Step 4 · Enter contact details
           - Full name, email, phone number
           - Property address and postcode
           - Only Sydney service areas are accepted

  Step 5 · Review and confirm
           - Customer sees a full summary of their booking
           - Clicks "Confirm Booking" to submit

  ✅ Booking is received. Customer sees a confirmation screen
     with their booking reference number.

  NOTE: The booking is NOT yet confirmed at this point.
        It is sitting in the system as "Awaiting Confirmation"
        until the admin reviews and approves it.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  STEP 2 — ADMIN REVIEWS THE BOOKING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  You (the business owner / admin) log into the Admin Panel.

  What you see on the dashboard:
  - Total bookings count
  - How many are new / confirmed / assigned / completed / cancelled
  - A full list of every booking with customer details

  For each new booking you can:

  ✅ Confirm it     → moves to "Confirmed"
                       slot is now officially blocked in the calendar
                       cleaner can be assigned

  ❌ Cancel it      → moves to "Cancelled"
                       slot is freed up for other customers

  🚩 Flag it        → moves to "Flagged for Review"
                       for suspicious or problematic bookings
                       slot stays open until you decide

  IMPORTANT: A time slot only becomes unavailable to new customers
             AFTER you confirm a booking. Pending bookings do not
             block the calendar — you are always in control.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  STEP 3 — ASSIGN A CLEANER TO THE JOB
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Once a booking is confirmed, you assign one of your cleaners.

  From the booking in the Admin Panel:
  - Select a cleaner from the dropdown list
  - Click "Assign"
  - Booking moves to "Cleaner Assigned"
  - The assigned cleaner can now see this job in their portal

  Only active cleaners appear in the dropdown.
  If a cleaner is deactivated, they won't show up.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  STEP 4 — CLEANER DOES THE JOB
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The cleaner logs into the Cleaner Portal (separate login).

  On their portal they can see:
  - All jobs assigned to them
  - Job details: address, date, time, service type, property size
  - Upcoming jobs vs completed jobs

  Once the job is done, the admin marks it as "Completed"
  from the Admin Panel.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  MANAGING YOUR CLEANERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Go to Admin Panel → Cleaners tab.

  You can:
  + Add a new cleaner          (name, email, phone, login details)
  ~ Activate / Deactivate      (toggle without deleting)
  - Remove a cleaner           (permanent delete)

  Deactivating a cleaner:
  - They can no longer log into the portal
  - They won't appear for new job assignments
  - Their existing assigned jobs are unaffected

  The number of active cleaners directly controls how many
  bookings can be taken per time slot. For example:
  - 2 active cleaners = up to 2 bookings per time slot
  - 3 active cleaners = up to 3 bookings per time slot


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  HOW CUSTOMERS TRACK THEIR BOOKING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Customers can visit:  yoursite.com/booking/lookup

  They enter the email address they used when booking.
  The system shows all their bookings with the current status.

  Status labels customers see:
  - "Awaiting Confirmation"  → waiting for admin approval
  - "Confirmed"              → booking is locked in
  - "Cleaner Assigned"       → a cleaner has been scheduled
  - "In Progress"            → cleaning is happening now
  - "Completed"              → job is done
  - "Cancelled"              → booking was cancelled
  - "Under Review"           → flagged, being looked into


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BOOKING STATUS LIFECYCLE AT A GLANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Customer submits → AWAITING CONFIRMATION
                           ↓
  Admin approves   → CONFIRMED
                           ↓

                           ↓
  Job starts       → IN PROGRESS
                           ↓
  Job done         → COMPLETED

  At any point    → CANCELLED  (admin cancels)
  At any point    → FLAGGED FOR REVIEW  (suspicious booking)


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  FRAUD & SPAM PROTECTION (BUILT IN)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The system automatically protects you from bad actors:

  - Only valid Sydney postcodes are accepted
  - All contact details are validated (real email format, etc.)
  - Suspicious bookings are automatically flagged for your review
    instead of being confirmed — you stay in control
  - Bookings cannot jump between statuses randomly —
    the system enforces the correct order at all times


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
